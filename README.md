# Petro API
Petrol API has been developed to provide a simple and easy to use API for petrol stations from Spain. We use the official API from the government of Spain to provide the data.
Petrol API normalize, standardize, let's filter and caches data [future update] to provide a better experience for our users and to improve performance.

We solve the problems of the official API that's seems to be done by someone with a poor knowledge of good practices in RESTful APIs.
